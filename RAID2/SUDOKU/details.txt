3. **Convert Input to Data Structure:**
    - Convert the input Sudoku puzzle into a suitable data structure for manipulation.
    - A common choice is a 2D array or slice.

4. **Solve the Sudoku:**
    - Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
    - The algorithm typically involves:
        - Finding an empty cell.
        - Trying numbers 1 through 9 in the empty cell.
        - Checking if the number is valid in the current position.
        - Recursively trying to solve the Sudoku with the chosen number.
        - If a solution is not found, backtrack and try the next number.
        - Repeat until a valid solution is found.

5. **Output:**
    - Once the Sudoku is solved, print the solution to the console.
    - If the input is invalid, print an error message.

Let's start implementing these steps in Go code. We'll create a new Go file, let's name it `sudoku_solver.go`.
